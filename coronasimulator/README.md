## Object Effects
### Metal
Metal is the basic building block in this sandbox. It has no special effects and simply sits there.
### Sand
Sand is the only object in this that gets affected by "gravity". Sand will fall downwards and will displace water if it lands in water.
### Water
Water flows in 3 random directions, Left, Right, and Down. It also collides with solid objects to either collect in them like a cup or spill down like on a counter. Water also deletes fire when in contact.
### Corona Bomb
Corona Bomb, or better seen as an infected cough infects people within a radius randomly. The closer to the source of the cough the more likely to be infected.
### Infections
Infected people are purple, and they infect people directly horizontal or vertical to them.
### Vaccinations
Vaccinations only work on non-infected people and will cause them to be immune to the virus, and help prevent spreading of the virus.
### Fire
Fire simply exists to be put out by water. Initially I was going to add smoke and trees but the time limit really put a damper on it.
### Person
People in this simply exist to be infected or vaccinated. They turn purple when infected and cyan when vaccinated.
